My name is Maria D’Angelo Berger, I am the owner and makeup artist of,\
**“A Soft Touch by Maria”**.

My love for makeup began as a little girl. As a young child I would watch my mom apply makeup in the mirror. She taught me that a little goes a long way. She would emphasize that soft colors such as pink and peach are colors that complement a lady’s appearance. As I grew older and more mature I would experiment with new and exciting colors of makeup.

I began to work in the corporate field where I gained knowledge and experience in marketing and business management. In 1996 I began to work for Lancome Cosmetics. While at Lancome they sent me to school where I learned from the best about the art of makeup. I was frequently asked and hired for print, television, film, fashion and celebrity makeup jobs. As my popularity grew I decided to go independent and start “A Soft Touch by Maria”. Where I have and continue to provide makeup services for all ages. My services can be tailored for fashion shows, model shoots, movies, videos, proms, baz mitzvahs, engagement parties, christenings, bridal showers, weddings and any special event you make have.

My clients are extremely diverse and come from many different backgrounds and ethnicities. My client requirements take me to NYC and it’s surrounding boroughs. I have also had requests for my talents that required travel by air to destinations such as South Beach, Miami, Los Angeles, Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

I treat all jobs as if they are for the cover of “Vogue” magazine. Look and feel your best. My creative and artistic talents will enhance your natural beauty.
